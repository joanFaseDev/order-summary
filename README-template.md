## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### About me

Hi everyone! I have to warn you about two things. First and foremost, english isn't my first language so please forgive me for any mispellings or grammatical errors. Secondly, i'm an aspiring front-end developper so i'm far from being the best learning material. Yet i'll do my best to explain my process, which choices i did and for what reasons. 

### Analysis 

The project is about recreating as closely as possible an order summary card based on two designs, a mobile and a desktop one. The layout inside the card doesn't change much between the two designs but the ratio height/width is clearly different. There's few elements inside, an image, some text, a tiny card about an annual plan and two buttons. 

### Planning

Here's how i'll proceed:

 - Create a *main* element to act as a flexbox container.
 - Create four *section* elements to act as flexbox items and also to enhance accessibility through semantic tag's use.
 - Write all contents in HTML file then proceed to implement basic styling (font-size, body's padding and margin reset, colors) and css variables.
 - Using flexbox properties, lay out the four main parts of the card (roughly distribute space and align items ) then work on smooth transition from mobile design to desktop one.
 - Once the transition is satisfying, go in details and try to replicate as closely as possible the padding / margin of the  template.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
